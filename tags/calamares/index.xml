      <description>Since i became Sabayon developer, i started to work on customizing it and giving some love to the entropy packages.
A lot as been done in those months, and you can see that picking up a &amp;ldquo;-dev&amp;rdquo; image from our mirrors.
After giving to the entropy packages a fullfill of love (systemd was bumped, ati-drivers and nvidia-drivers as well to be in line with upstream, implemented iptables saving rules for systemd, &amp;hellip; ) then we decided that the time of Anaconda installer was finished.</description>
