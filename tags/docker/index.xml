With spawning a compilation, the second line (with the package you wish to merge) is it possible to point to a specific version of a package. For example, atm I&amp;rsquo;d like to merge app-editors/atom-1.2.0 from the Sabayon overlay, do I have to enter it as `app-editors/atom-1.2.0 &amp;ndash;overlay sabayon` or `=app-editors/atom-1.2.0 &amp;ndash;overlay sabayon`?
In section 3 I think you gave incorrect syntax, although it may be because of formatting limitations imposed by blogger.</description>

      <description>As previously anticipated in the previous blog post, here i explain what&amp;rsquo;s going on with Sabayon Docker images, and how can the Official Sabayon images help you in developing/deploying your application. In this article, i&amp;rsquo;ll show how to build Sabayon/Gentoo packages using Docker.
I&amp;rsquo;ll cover five cases and will be divided in differents articles:
You want to build packages locally You want to remotely build packages You want to host an overlay or a Sabayon repository and want your packages to get built on each push to the git repository You want to track remote repository changes and test (useful if you can&amp;rsquo;t setup a webhook) Setup an Entropy repo with a Docker image, and how to mantain packages In future, i&amp;rsquo;ll write also a post also on how to track the packages remotely with CircleCi.</description>

      <description>Since i became Sabayon developer, i started to work on customizing it and giving some love to the entropy packages.
A lot as been done in those months, and you can see that picking up a &amp;ldquo;-dev&amp;rdquo; image from our mirrors.
After giving to the entropy packages a fullfill of love (systemd was bumped, ati-drivers and nvidia-drivers as well to be in line with upstream, implemented iptables saving rules for systemd, &amp;hellip; ) then we decided that the time of Anaconda installer was finished.</description>
