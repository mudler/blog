      <description>Updates, TMiD (This Month in the Dev world)
Something landed here! Thanks to +Ben RobertsÂ for the donation!
ARM Marsala, the board that +Ben Roberts was so kind to donate has just landed here, and i&amp;rsquo;m very happy about it, because that means that i can test against the board again myself.
I&amp;rsquo;m glad also to announce that the ROS framework and some other goodies(among of them firefox and libreoffice) have been pushed into our ARM repo.</description>

      <description>Sabayon, official call for testers (and well, developers are welcome too)
Testers, come to us Probably most of you already have seen Ballmer in show-mode
Also if controversial, it was a quite funny commercial / raindance move, balls included. But i can say that he is wrong, testers are as important as developers.
Consider helping Sabayon in a different way: testing it.
I am here, begging YOU for some help. The more the merrier!</description>
