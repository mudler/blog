      <description>Sabayon, official call for testers (and well, developers are welcome too)
Testers, come to us Probably most of you already have seen Ballmer in show-mode
Also if controversial, it was a quite funny commercial / raindance move, balls included. But i can say that he is wrong, testers are as important as developers.
Consider helping Sabayon in a different way: testing it.
I am here, begging YOU for some help. The more the merrier!</description>
