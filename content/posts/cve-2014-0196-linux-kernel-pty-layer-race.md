Two days ago a temible exploit was released for local privilage escalation in the linux kernel. The bug was found on the [29th of April](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=875690): memory corruption via a race in pty write handling , affected kernels are 2.6.31 -> 3.14rcX  
  
The n\_tty\_write function in drivers/tty/n\_tty.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access in the "LECHO & !OPOST" case, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or gain privileges by triggering a race condition involving read and write operations with long strings.  
  
There is an exploit available for local privilage escalation, written by Matthew Daley and can be found [here](http://bugzillafiles.novell.org/attachment.cgi?id=589445) . There was also an attempt before for local DOS thru the same bug, that can be found [here](http://pastebin.com/yTSFUBgZ).  
  
Just waiting for a kernel release :)
