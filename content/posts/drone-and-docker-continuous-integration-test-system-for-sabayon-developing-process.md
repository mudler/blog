Plasma 5.4

The KDE team announced on 25 August the release of Plasma 5.4:  

> This release of Plasma brings many nice touches for our users such as much improved high DPI support, KRunner auto-completion and many new beautiful Breeze icons. It also lays the ground for the future with a tech preview of Wayland session available. We're shipping a few new components such as an Audio Volume Plasma Widget, monitor calibration tool and the User Manager tool comes out beta. [Look at the official press release here](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.4.0.php?site_locale=en)

  
  
Useless to say, the KDE team is doing a great work, and i'm really excited to see what's _next()_
