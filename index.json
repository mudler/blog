Sabayon Community Repositories is here!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello users,\nTime passed when i first wrote the article \u0026ldquo;[Part 1] Building Gentoo and Sabayon packages in your machine locally or remotely with Docker and Cloud Services\u0026rdquo; that was going to be divided into parts. But things changed amazingly fast and there is better news, I wrote up a suite of tools that makes the whole operation much easier, thanks also to +Ben Roberts (optiz0r) who contributed in the development and he is also kindly sponsoring the buildserver.\nSome of you probably already heard about Sabayon Community Repositories (SCR) that we announced in the developers mailing list some weeks ago, if not, keep reading. The SCR Build System is an improvement of the methodology explicated before, but with a lot of extras and automated features. This is how SCR is born.\nTL;DR\nInformation and how-to use: Wiki page (under construction)\nSearch available packages: SCR website\nPackages requests: Bugzilla section\nContributing/setup a local development environment: How-to contribute\nGuidelines and Bylaws (for SCR Devs): scr-docs Github repository\nSabayon Community Repositories SCR is a collection of repositories available to Sabayon users, that could be enabled/removed from the system by using enman \u0026ndash; our layman equivalent \u0026ndash; this ensures not only that a user can easily revert his mistakes ( SCR content is not as stable as main repos, and we put a lot of warnings in the website for this reason) but also that it\u0026rsquo;s easier and faster than ever now having bleeding edge packages that are not in the official channels.\nUsers can search packages in the SCR website, that will display information on how to install them.\nMore information on how to use SCR is available in the wiki page (under construction). Meanwhile we are currently working on the project documentation: Guidelines and Bylaws can be found on the scr-docs Github repository.\nUsage Open a terminal and run the following as root!\n1) Disable weekly repositories and enable current:\nsudo mv /etc/entropy/repositories.conf.d/entropy\\_sabayonlinux.org{.example,} equo repo disable sabayon-weekly\nequo repo enable sabayonlinux.org ``` **2)** Update/upgrade your machine ``` equo up \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo equo u ``` **3)** Install **enman**: ``` equo i enman ``` We are now ready to use SCR! **4)** Enable the community repository: ``` enman add community ``` Update just the community repository database: ``` equo up community ``` Now we can search as usual packages with \u0026#34;equo search\u0026#34; or, you can list the repository content with \u0026#34;equo query\u0026#34;: ``` equo q list available community ``` Special Purpose Repositories ---------------------------- These repositories contain packages to satisfy a particular purpose and that are not suitable for inclusion in the \u0026#34;community\u0026#34; repository. These should be enabled with care, and only if you need the specific functionality they provide. Example special purpose repositories: * \u0026#34;**devel**\u0026#34;: Contains live versions of core Sabayon packages, and can be used to develop future Sabayon improvements against upstream projects, such as the Calamares installer, or the Linux Kernel. * \u0026#34;**gaming-live**\u0026#34;: Contains bleeding edge graphics drivers which may add new features or hardware support but may contain bugs or cause crashes. * \u0026#34;**kde-unstable**\u0026#34;: Contains the very latest KDE packages, which haven\u0026#39;t gone through the same level of QA as you would find for KDE versions made available via Entropy. * \u0026#34;**pentesting**\u0026#34;: Contains various pentesting packages Development and Contributing ---------------------------- From a developer point of view, - feel free to skip that if you don\u0026#39;t need to build your packages - the approach is more easier: [we are using building specifications files that describes what the repository should contain](https://github.com/Sabayon/community-repositories) (and how to make that possible). The awesome side of this is that the entire infrastructure and the repository as well are replicable everytime. [In our wiki there is a page regarding on how to setup the infrastructure](https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Contributing_to_SCR) (the same we use on the Build Server) in your local machine, enabling you to locally-build repositories without having to care about setting up a chroot! just put in a configuration file the relevants bits and you are done! Package requests ---------------- If you don\u0026#39;t mind on how all of this works, but you want a package to be added in the SCR repositories, feel free to open a bug request [in the specific section of our Bugzilla](https://bugs.sabayon.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community%20Repositories): be sure to specify if the ebuild is available in layman if you want it to get done faster. Donations --------- As you can see we are always busy to give you the Sabayon experience, but we really need your help now! [Consider donating](https://www.sabayon.org/donate)!

This is what almost every distribution does for tons of reasons, among them i want just to underline that in those years we have seen a lot of new ARM boards out of there and we can\u0026rsquo;t just support all of them, mantain a kernel branch for each one would results low QA (since our dev-team is small) and probably in hard decision to be made when support will be dropped from vendors (think also on how short is a board lifespan, and how projects dies quickly). In that way, we can still provide support also for legacy devices as well.\nIf someone intends to support the various kernels it\u0026rsquo;s free to do it by forking the project or just creating a separate overlay with kernel ebuilds, there is no limitations at all, the Sabayon kernel eclass is ready to handle most of the task if you intend to dig in that deep ocean. If you want to help us to support other boards, head over the GitHub repository that contains the Docker bits to assemble the final images.\nTo sum up: we will release board specific images, and generic images that will suit for most every board. The generic image won\u0026rsquo;t always work out of the box, some of them need custom specific vendor bits (U-boot) to be in the right place, but we will document each board we can manage to put our hands on.\nUpgrading the kernel or playing with it will be entirely all up to you, we will provide of course a bunch of scripts to help that process.\n**Sabayon will support the ARM packages, built from Gentoo\u0026rsquo;s portage, providing you a stable, rolling release rootfs with tons of tools you can install with Entropy. **\nEnough chitchat for now, let\u0026rsquo;s get to the business, let me present you our Tech Preview of RaspberryPi2.

In this article, i\u0026rsquo;ll show how to build Sabayon/Gentoo packages using Docker.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll cover five cases and will be divided in differents articles:\nYou want to build packages locally You want to remotely build packages You want to host an overlay or a Sabayon repository and want your packages to get built on each push to the git repository You want to track remote repository changes and test (useful if you can\u0026rsquo;t setup a webhook) Setup an Entropy repo with a Docker image, and how to mantain packages In future, i\u0026rsquo;ll write also a post also on how to track the packages remotely with CircleCi.\nIntroduction It has been a while that i\u0026rsquo;m putting my head on how i could leverage Cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s free services to build packages and improve the QA of the building process at all. Continous Integration applied to Linux Distribution Developing process can lead to quite awesome perspectives. [I will digress on this on a future article]\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Docker..What the heck is Docker? From their site:\nDocker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.\nWe can look at Docker like a box which can be filled to be used like an entire OS, but at the same time share the kernel with the host (sorry to be much semplicistic, we are not discussing about the Docker technlogy here).\nDifferents images, differents purposes The Sabayon images provides the software stack present on the Entropy repositories, thus allowing easily to use emerge (Gentoo package manager), equo (Sabayon package manager) and Eit (Sabayon repository manager) in an every linux distribution (So, also aliens can use it). At Sabayon, we currently are providing various flavors of Docker images, the most useful for developers/users/hobbist are: sabayon/base-amd64: A light image that ships the minimum Sabayon package set sabayon/spinbase-amd64: It is based on base-amd64, and includes kernel, software that is required to create the SpinBase.iso images that finally hits our mirrors sabayon/builder-amd64: This image have all the packages required to compile packages with emerge, includes an helper script to do most common tasks automatically sabayon/molecules-amd64: This image features the Sabayon Molecule tool with the molecules git repository inside, it is just an aim to easily let people burn their custom spins. The other images that you can see in our public profile are used to convert a Gentoo image to Sabayon, everything translated in Docker steps.\nWhile the sabayon/base-amd64 image can be used to deploy your services, and be the base of your applications container, the sabayon/builder-amd64 is a ready-to-use image to build package, it\u0026rsquo;s all already setup for you.\nAs already said, i\u0026rsquo;m going to cover four cases here, then you are free to pick up the solution that suits you well.\nIn this part i\u0026rsquo;m going to talk on how to build packages locally, without having to setup your environment.\nBuilding the packages locally with Docker I\u0026rsquo;ll start from the easier task. Building packages with your machine.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that there is an ebuild available in an overlay, which you are interested in and is not available in Entropy. Consider of course, that not all ebuilds will compile, some are not mantained and not work as expected.\nWe are going to use the sabayon/builder-amd64 image to build portage packages.\nSetup Here we need docker to be installed in your machine, i\u0026rsquo;m assuming that you are running Sabayon here, but this is merely optional, docker can be used also on Debian, Gentoo, Fedora or whatever you want.\n_sudo equo i docker _\nsudo systemctl start docker\nThere we go, this is the unique software that we actually want.\nIf you want the Docker service to be launched on boot:\n_ sudo systemctl enable docker_\nPull(download) the image Now let\u0026rsquo;s download the sabayon/builder-amd64 image:\nsudo docker pull sabayon/builder-amd64\nNote: If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use sudo on each docker command, put your user into the \u0026ldquo;docker\u0026rdquo; group.\n3) Spawn a compilation Let\u0026rsquo;s say that now we want to compile app-text/tree. Now we can launch a new container from the sabayon/builder-amd64 image, giving it as argument the package we want to compile:\nsudo docker run -ti \u0026ndash;rm -v \u0026ldquo;$PWD\u0026rdquo;/artifacts:/usr/portage/packages sabayon/builder-amd64 app-text/tree\nNow the builder machine will try to compile your package downloading first all the (available) dependencies it can find from Entropy and setting your container to face the compilation phase properly.\nWhen docker run will exit, you will find then your package under the \u0026ldquo;artifacts\u0026rdquo; directory under the directory where you launched the command. If your package was in another overlay, the builder machine supports to fetch automatically overlays, you just have to tell what are the overlays you need:\nsudo docker run -ti \u0026ndash;rm -v \u0026ldquo;$PWD\u0026rdquo;/artifacts:/usr/portage/packages sabayon/builder-amd64 app-text/tree \u0026ndash;overlay NAME\nwhere:\n**--rm **tells docker to destroy the container as soon as it exits -v determines the mount of a directory between the host and the container. On the left side of the doublepoints \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; there is the host directory, on the right the container one. The host folder will be mounted on the directory specified on the container so we can share data. --overlay NAME: you can specify an overlay where your package is available, for example, we might want to compile the new gnome available in the gnome overlay. This command can be chained to list more than one overlay to fetch _(\u0026ndash;_overlay1 \u0026ndash;overlay2, ecc.. ) You might also want to save your changes to the image, meaning to mantain your building machine state. This can be accomplished with docker, using \u0026ldquo;docker commit\u0026rdquo;. How to use this image is up to your imagination.\nMOAR Options (Here be dragons) Docker allows to share directories with the host system, gracefully mounting them on start up. We can specify to Docker in it\u0026rsquo;s definition file that we want some volumes to not be shipped with the image itself, but instead being mounted on the host system everytime we run it. As for example, we can tell to Docker to use the directory foo as our /usr/portage directory, allowing us to cache Portage files, including distfiles and packages.\ndocker run -t -i sabayon/base-amd64 -v \u0026ldquo;$PWD\u0026rdquo;/foo:/usr/portage -t tells to docker to allocate a pseudo-tty for us, allowing to run an interactive shell -i keep the STDIN attached also if not active -v sets the volume, so \u0026ldquo;$PWD\u0026rdquo;/foo will contain the /usr/portage content of the container and vice-versa (its mounted) ** **the last argument is the command that we want to launch inside the container, we could of course launch other commands here, this is just an example If you don\u0026rsquo;t have already pulled the docker image (docker pull sabayon/base-amd64) this will be done automatically, leaving you to use just one command.\nExample - Advanced The -v flag can furthermore exploited and chained to obtain more fine-grained tweaks\n_Going to cover a minor example regarding sabayon/builder-amd64 image here. _\nYou can of course customize it further, and replace all the configuration that\u0026rsquo;s already been setup on the Docker Image.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create 5 files in a directory, corresponding to the customization you might need from your building process.\ncustom.unmask: will contain your unmasks custom.mask: will contain your masks custom.use: will contain your use flags custom.env: will contain your env specifications custom.keywords: will contain your keywords Exporting those files to your container is a matter of adding an argument to your docker run command.\nExample. Exporting your custom.unmask: -v /my/path/custom.unmask:/opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/package.unmask/custom.unmask\nExample. Exporting your custom.mask: _-v /my/path/custom.mask:/opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/package.mask/custom.mask _\nExample. Exporting your custom.use: _-v /my/path/custom.use:/opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/package.use/custom.use _\nExample. Exporting your custom.env: -v /my/path/custom.env:/opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/package.env/custom.env\nExample. Exporting your custom.keywords: -v /my/path/custom.keywords:/opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/package.keywords/custom.keywords\nIn this way you tell to docker to mount your custom.* file inside /opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/package.*/custom.* inside the container. Keep in mind that the container have the portage directory located at /opt/sabayon-build/conf/intel/portage/ ; the /etc/portage folder is then symlinked to it.\nAttention! Remember also to use absolute paths or docker will fail to mount your files in the container.\nThe image then will call a script that provides to do most of the things automatically for you, but there are some environment variables that you can use to tweak it\u0026rsquo;s default behavior:\nBUILDER_PROFILE: Sets the profile for compilation, you can select it using the number or the name BUILDER_JOBS: How much jobs emerge will have assigned (-j option) USE_EQUO: 1/0 Enable/Disable equo for installing the package dependencies (if you plan to use a pure gentoo repository, set it to 0, but the compilation process would be much longer) PRESERVED_REBUILD: 1/0 to Enable/Disable preserved rebuild compilation EMERGE_DEFAULTS_ARGS: a list of commands that you might want to specify FEATURES: you can override default FEATURES (like in Portage\u0026rsquo;s make.conf) To pass an environment variable to the docker container we set them like this:\n-e \u0026ldquo;OPTION1=VALUE1\u0026rdquo; -e \u0026ldquo;OPTION2=VALUE2\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now!\n","permalink":"https://mudler.pm/2015/11/part-1-building-gentoo-and-sabayon.html","tags":["sabayon","docker","equo","gentoo"],"title":"[Part 1] Building Gentoo and Sabayon packages in your machine locally or remotely with Docker and Cloud Services"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I will give it a go installing new motherboard tod\u0026hellip; Unknown - Oct 4, 2015\nI will give it a go installing new motherboard today will start testing after thate\nThanks for your efforts , please remember to file a bug for whatever problem you will face!\nI have jut installed a new motherboard,it is a msi z97a the only problem so far is I cant install sabayon in uefi mode I am runing 15.10 on the other hard dive fedora 22 xfce installed in uefi mode no problem\nexcuse my punctuation today please\nnot in UEFI mode? there are some error messages?\nNo no error messages just wont install in uefi mode.I will try putting 15.10 on a dvd and see if it installs ok\n15.10 will not install on this new wiz bang machine in uefi mode.motherboard msi z97a,cpu intel core i7-4770k CPU @ 3.50GHz,s,graphics card [AMD/ATI] Curacao XT [Radeon R7 370 / R9 270X/370 OEM],memory 31.4 GIB of ram.the strange part is fedora of any flavour installs in uefi mode so I am at a loss as to know why sabayon wont install in uefi mode,I have tried 2 different usb sticks still no luck\nWhat program are you using to burn the sticks? as far as i can test UEFI mode works on all my PC\nI use fedora live usb creator,I can get to the installion screen but it just hangs there\nI just tried unetbootin and a cd/dvd all doing the same thing hanging at the install screen.fedora 22 xfce and fedora 22 plasma both install no problem\nregards Ron\nTry to use dd to burn the image instead\njust did a new download of 15.10 from different mirror it boots in bios mode not uefi,it still hangs at install screen in uefi mode so will install in bios mode\ncould my new graphics card be blocking uefi install\njust been in touch with msi they are lelling me its a prblem with uefi on sabayon is why it wont install in uefi mode so I wont be installing sabayon\nsorry regards Ron\nHello Ettote just letting you know I am going back to a asrock extreme 4 motherboard so I can run sabayon I miss sabayon\nup and running with new asrock motherboard running sabayon 15.10 kde only problem sddm not working properly will file bug report\nreplace sddm with lightdm, it is known to have bugs, new Sabayon KDE version will ship lightdm :)\n","permalink":"https://mudler.pm/2015/10/sabayon-testers-testers-testers.html","tags":["sabayon","torvalds","updates","linux","server","developers","testers","entropy","ballmer"],"title":"Sabayon: testers, testers, testers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Sabayon, official call for testers (and well, developers are welcome too)\nTesters, come to us Probably most of you already have seen Ballmer in show-mode\nAlso if controversial, it was a quite funny commercial / raindance move, balls included.

(be careful to download the image dated after 8th October)\nJust a note: if you wonder how you have to set network configuration after install, we ship NetworkManager that provides nmtui (the console frontend)\nImportant packages coming up, and now in testing On the testing repositories now are available the following \u0026ldquo;critical\u0026rdquo; packages in testing:\nLatest 4.2.3 kernel AtiDrivers 15.9(expanding supported cards) Nvidia Drivers 355.11 systemd 226 VirtualBox 5.0.6 Calamares 1.1.4.1 Libreoffice 5.0.1.2 If you encounter in any issue, please file a bug here. Help us also enabling the testing repository If you are wondering how to put your hands on the shiny new testing packages here it is a small how-to:\nequo repo disable sabayon-weekly\nequo repo enable sabayonlinux.org equo repo enable sabayon-limbo\ntaken from the wiki.\nAnd as we work, meanwhile in the world\u0026hellip; Meanwhile our \u0026ldquo;Sith Lord\u0026rdquo; Linus Torvalds is screaming among Kernel devs, a fancy meme appeared on my G+, i couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist to share it to you\nby the way, I agree with his philosophy on that, people if wants REALLY learn things, most of the times needs to be beaten up a little bit, like your mom used to, and to be frank, it should be considered a honor to be yelled by Linus\nCheers\n","permalink":"https://mudler.pm/2015/10/sabayon-testers-testers-testers.html","tags":["sabayon","torvalds","updates","linux","server","developers","testers","entropy","ballmer"],"title":"Sabayon: testers, testers, testers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\nImage: an ancient hen-foot print found on Mars (Mars Photo credit to NASA)\nSabayon 15.10 is a modern and easy to use Linux distribution based on Gentoo, following an extreme, yet reliable, rolling release model.\nThis is a monthly release generated, tested and published to mirrors by our build servers containing the latest and greatest collection of software available in the Entropy repositories.\nThe ChangeLog files related to this release are available on our mirrors.\nThe list of packages included in each Sabayon flavor is available inside*.pkglist\u0026quot; files. Our team is always busy packaging the latest and greatest stuff. If you want to have a look at what\u0026rsquo;s inside our repositories, just go to our packages website.\nPlease read on to know where to find the images and their torrent files on our mirrors.\nLong life to new and shiny Calamares! As already pre-announced we switched the default installer. Anaconda served us well, but we decided to embrace the community-baked Calamares, the Distribution-independent installer! If you don\u0026rsquo;t know it, checkout their website. Also if it is young and some features are missing, it is lighter and bug-less wrt our old installer.\nPlasma 5 KDE releases now ships by default the new Plasma 5. Yes, you heard it well! Sabayon 15.10 KDE spin\nSteam Big Picture and MCE mode gone ( for now ) Since we had to put much effort in making a working release with Calamares and along with other new packages, we had to ditch Steam Big Picture mode and Media Center installation options. Yeah, we are sorry about that: but this is just a sad story that we hope to fix soon.\nDocker We now offer official docker releases as well. You can find them in our official docker profile.\nThere also is a Docker image available to build Sabayon packages as well, without the need to have all the tools required in your existing machine.\nFuture plans You know that our habits are a bit evil-ish. We have a lot of stuff in the pipeline, just to spoiler a bit: you soon again should see a Sabayon Server Edition and hopefully also an ARM release.\nAvailable releases As for now we offer 64bit images only.\nBut you are free to choose between the wonderful minimalism of GNOME, the eyecandy of KDE or the old fart called Xfce. If you are the kind of person who just needs Fluxbox/Openbox/whatever else, just get the Minimal image and you won\u0026rsquo;t be hit by the \u0026ldquo;OMG candies\u0026rdquo; bloat that is in the other images.\nBinary vs Source Package Manager It\u0026rsquo;s up to you whether turn a newly Sabayon installation into a geeky Gentoo ~arch system or just camp on the lazy side and enjoy the power of our binary, dumbed down Applications Manager (a.k.a. Rigo). With Sabayon you are really in control of your system the way you really want. Read the wiki page if you plan mixing the two package managers.\nNative NVIDIA and AMD GPU drivers support All our releases natively support the latest and greatest GPU hardware from NVIDIA and AMD through their proprietary drivers. Whether you want to enjoy your Linux rig for gaming or video playback, you can. For AMD hardware though, we default to the Open Source implementation for the supported cards. Make sure to pass \u0026ldquo;nomodeset\u0026rdquo; to the boot command line to force the proprietary drivers to be used instead: head over the wiki for more details.\nLTSI Linux Kernels, 3.10, 3.12 offered We are now tracking the 3.10, 3.12, 3.14 Long Term Stable Linux kernels, offering (almost) same-day updates to them. If you are using Sabayon in a server environment, you surely welcome this. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re using Sabayon on your laptop, desktop workstation, switching between kernels or just moving to a new version has become a no-brainer operation through Rigo: just go to the preferences menu, select the kernel menu (LTS and regular kernels are listed in separate menus), pick a kernel and click \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo;. Rigo will take care of updating external modules in a reliable and safe way on your behalf.\nLinks Sabayon Mirrors Page Sabayon on Docker Hub Sabayon Monthly Images Download Page Sabayon BitTorrent Tracker Join us on Facebook Join us on Google+ Donate to Sabayon!

Basically we distinguish here 2 kind of nodes:\nmasters (that represent the most capable hardware machine)\nagents or basics nodes. A basic node can either be an agent or a master.\nThe master takes the requests of agent\u0026rsquo;s nodes, process them in a unique interface and send a reply back, so you will talk to the same Entity but you can ask things in parallel in different places on the house/infrastructure.\nThe Agents can be a PC or an embedded device and we plan to give also a display interface.\n1) Prerequisites Git - Installation how-to SQLite - Installation how-to SoX - Installation ubuntu You can check if sqlite it\u0026rsquo;s already installed issuing the following command: sqlite3\nSame applies to git and sox.\n2) Preparation Let\u0026rsquo;s fire up our terminal, and prepare a directory that will contain all the configuration files:\nmkdir ~/google_at_home cd ~/google_at_home\n3) Installing App::cpanminus Let\u0026rsquo;s be sure that we have installed also App::cpanminus\na) debian in debian we can just do:\napt-get install cpanminus\nb) general install otherwise, if your vendor doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship it and you have cpan (you have it, trust me):\ncpan App::cpanminus\nc) script install You can also install cpanminus by issuing that command in your terminal:\ncurl -L http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - \u0026ndash;sudo App::cpanminus\n4) Installing IntelliHome libraries Now let\u0026rsquo;s install the libraries in the system (you can install it on the same user, if you intend to run google-at-home from there)\ncpanm git@github.com:IntelliHome/Google-at-Home.git\n5) Clone the repository Now we need to clone the repo as well locally to grab the configuration files\ngit clone git@github.com:IntelliHome/Google-at-Home.git cd Google-at-Home\n6) Basic configuration (optional) By default, the database would be installed on /var/tmp/intellihome.db, to change it you just need to edit the config/database.yml. Here you can also set your language (e.g. for english language: \u0026rsquo;en\u0026rsquo;).\n7) Plugin installation Now let\u0026rsquo;s procede to install the Wikipedia plugin (that allows querying with voice wikipedia) and the Relay plugin (that enables to commands remote relay attached to your RaspberryPis)\ncpanm git@github.com:IntelliHome/IntelliHome-Plugin-Wikipedia.git\ncpanm git@github.com:IntelliHome/IntelliHome-Plugin-Relay.git\nIn this article, we are just showing how to install them, since the relay plugin should be configured to work (such as registering the relays on the boards).\n8) Database deploy The database will keep record of the nodes on your network and the plugin installed on your system.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s prepare the SQLite backend:\nperl intellihome-deployer -b SQLite -c prepare\nAnd deploy it:\nperl intellihome-deployer -b SQLite -c install\n9) Enable your plugins Now the master node is ready, we just need to register the plugins that we intend to use:\nperl intellihome-master -i Wikipedia\nperl intellihome-master -i Relay\n(to remove them use -r)\n10) Start the software a) Start the server Let\u0026rsquo;s start the master process now:\nperl intellihome-master\nThis will spawn also the web interface, avaible now on http://localhost:8080. It\u0026rsquo;s under development, so you can just add/delete the nodes/gpio and tagging them for further use.\nb) Start the local node Since this tutorial aim is just to work on the local machine, now you can spawn the node process\nperl intellihome-node\nYou are now ready to go, try to speak at your microphone and say \u0026ldquo;wikipedia house\u0026rdquo; to have your answer.\nIf you encounter issues or bugs, please fill a bug request here\nA big thank you to Vytas and dgikiller for the help and the contributions to the project.\n","permalink":"https://mudler.pm/2014/10/google-at-home-installation-1-howto.html","tags":null,"title":"Google at Home installation [#1 Howto]"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Predicting github contrib calendar with Perl and PDL\nPremise : this is my first time using PDL\nLately i had the chance to put my hands on PDL, i was glad to discover that it\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\nI come from a matlab/octave and Mathematica background, at first was a bit difficult to dig thru the PDL equivalents functions and i have to admit that PyMC has some fancy stuff that require a lot of code to implement in PDL and i wanted to borrow in that case.\nBut after all, i begun to love the syntax, and the perl integration with sci-libs is a great stuff: allows to pack up your result also in a web interface and it\u0026rsquo;s damn fast.\nThe idea was to predict the future github contribution calendar of a user, since it\u0026rsquo;s representation in the profile page is a CA where each box can be in 1 of 5 available states represented by the quartiles of the normal distribution over the range [0, max(c)] , where max(c) stands for the maximum commits ever done in a day (within the range of maximum a year).\nA transition probability matrix is filled up, using Bayes inference for calculating the probabilities of jumping in each of the possible states and then the Markov chain is computed to give you the result of the prediction for the next week.\nI was very glad to see how can be neat (thanks so much to PDL devs) to wrap a probability density function used for the inference in few lines of code:\nsub prob { my $x = zeroes(100)-\u0026gt;xlinvals( 0, 1 ); return $x-\u0026gt;index(maximum_ind(pdf_beta( $x, ( 1 + $_[1] ),( 1 + $_[0] - $_[1] ) ) )); } Instead of calculating the markov chain for the next states powering the matrix of the transition probabilities, by default the commits are split up by day and with a dedicated transition matrix for each one, since in my opinion developers habits are more likely to show up on the same days (but i added an option to calculate the probabilities also by powering and using just one transition matrix if you wish to compare the results).\nPerl comes handy in every situation, and that said was pretty fast to set up a web interface for the algorithm using Mojolicious: link.\nMore predictions that you folks are going to make, more you will help me to improve the algorithm to do better predictions. Suggestions, comments, issues, pull requests are welcome.\nAll the code is available on github: the GitInsight module and the web interface.\nThe future improvements would interests more fine grained quartile calculations( this implementation is just a beta, and probably not suitable for devs that have \u0026gt;200/300 commits), and better prediction trying to detect when a user changes behaviour, highlighting that particular period of time.

We are now lovely notified about Perl love across all our devices.\nCheers!\n","permalink":"https://mudler.pm/2014/05/love-for-pushbullet.html","tags":null,"title":"love for pushbullet"},{"categories":null,"contents":"_\nThese months are full of bugs to put hands on, there are multiple vulnerabilities (3) found in libXfont that trusts the font server protocol data, and not verifying that the values will not overflow or cause other damage._\nFrom the Alan Coopersmith announce:\nIlja van Sprundel, a security researcher with IOActive, has discovered several issues in the way the libXfont library handles the responses it receives from xfs servers, and has worked with X.Org\u0026rsquo;s security team to analyze, confirm, and fix these issues.\nMost of these issues stem from libXfont trusting the font server to send valid protocol data, and not verifying that the values will not overflow or cause other damage. This code is commonly called from the X server when an X Font Server is active in the font path, so may be running in a setuid-root process depending on the X server in use. Exploits of this path could be used by a local, authenticated user to attempt to raise privileges; or by a remote attacker who can control the font server to attempt to execute code with the privileges of the X server. (CVE-2014-0209 is the exception, as it does not involve communication with a font server)\nRead more here\nThe three bugs actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a real exploit in the wild.. so we can feel secure for now\u0026hellip; but will be a matter of time! The remote attack needs the control of the font server, so shouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect a lot of servers, but for the local priviledges escalation it\u0026rsquo;s a cake :)\n","permalink":"https://mudler.pm/2014/05/multiple-issues-in-libxfont.html","tags":null,"title":"Multiple issues in libXfont"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Two days ago a temible exploit was released for local privilage escalation in the linux kernel.

[enhancement] switched to pulseaudio+SoX for recording [enhancement] Now microphone levels are adjusted automatically (you can disable this feature commenting out from nodes.yaml the mic_upper_threshold and mic_lower_threshold) starting to work with my GSoC student to help him thru the code and defying a r scheme to follow for the SQLite porting.
